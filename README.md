# Pomodoro_Project
This project is a hardware-based Pomodoro productivity timer built using an Arduino, powered by a DS3231 for accurate timekeeping and a DFPlayer Mini for audio reminders and break music.

The system automatically manages focus sessions, short breaks, and long breaks, while also displaying a countdown to a target review/exam date.
